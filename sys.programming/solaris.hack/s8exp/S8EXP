   Description
   syscall priocntl(2) is used as process scheduler control
   it's declared as below:
   long priocntl(idtype_t idtype, id_t id, int cmd, /* arg */ ...);
   while set 'cmd' arg to PC_GETCID, priocntl()'s function is like below
   (see ManPage 'man -s 2 priocntl')
   "Get class ID and class attributes for a specific class
   given class name. The idtype and id arguments are
   ignored. If arg is non-null, it points to a structure
   of type pcinfo_t. The pc_clname buffer contains the
   name of the class whose attributes you are getting."
   as it said, pc_clname points to a string specify the module.
   priocntl() will load the module without any privilege check.
   The module's name is a relative path, priocntl will search the module
   file
   in only /kernel/sched and /usr/kernel/sched/ dirs.
   but unfortunately, priocntl() never check '../' in pc_clname arg
   we can use '../../../tmp/module' to make priocntl() load a module from
   anywhere
   For more detail, read the sources.
   flkm.c the module source
   final.c the loader source
   How to Use?
   1.Extract release.tgz to a folder
   2.use "isainfo -b" to know what platform is running
   3.under 32-bit solaris, execute "./final"
   under 64-bit solaris, execute "./final 64"
   How to Patch?
   Patch From: Casper Dik (Casper.Dik@Sun.COM)
   The "pc_clname[]" argument is limited in size; to prevent this
   particular
   bug from being exploited you could:
   for dir in /kernel /usr/kernel
   do
   cd $dir
   mkdir -p a/b/c/d/e/f/g/h but a/b/c/d/e/f/g/h/i/j/k/l/m/n/o/p/q
   mv sched a/b/c/d/e/f/g/h but a/b/c/d/e/f/g/h/i/j/k/l/m/n/o/p/q
   ln -s a/b/c/d/e/f/g/h but a/b/c/d/e/f/g/h/i/j/k/l/m/n/o/p/q/sched .
   done
   Casper
   I think the patch above is a quick but dirty method :-)
